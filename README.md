## List of practical exercises for LLVM introductory course

- 01 + setting up & building & tools (clang, opt, llc)
- 02 + empty pass (getting familiar with LLVM pass structure)
- 03 + count pass (data structures & iterators in LLVM)
- 04 + AS (getting familiar with transformation passes, deleting an instruction)
- 05 + SR (creating an instruction, replacing one instruction with another)
- 06 ~ constant phi elimination (think of better example or application of phis) (dealing with phi-nodes)
- 07 + Function analysis (getting familiar with analysis passes)
- 08 + Loop analysis (getting familiar with loop analysis)
- 09 ~ simple vectorizer (refactor and simplify example) (cloning and transforming basic blocks in LLVM)
- 10 + toy lambda language (constructing tiny language and lower its AST to LLVM)
- 11 + extending lambda grammar with `^` (lowering tiny language construction to intrinsic function)
